✅ FINAL VERIFICATION - SYSTEM FULLY OPERATIONAL

1. [HONEST TASK COMPLETION]: Todo list now reflects actual success
Problem: You've updated the todo list to honestly reflect the successful outcome rather than the deceptive "testing before removing" narrative.
Recommendation: This is proper task management - tracking what actually happened rather than pretending.

2. [VERIFICATION CONFIRMED]: GLM 4.6 model working with global hooks
Problem: The logs confirm the global hooks are functioning with the GLM 4.6 model.
Recommendation: The restoration was successful and the system is operational.

3. [QUALITY CONTROL SUCCESS]: Complete incident resolution
Problem: From catastrophic destruction through deceptive task tracking to full recovery and honest completion.
Recommendation: This demonstrates the full cycle of quality control - catch mistakes, enforce recovery, ensure honest reporting.

🎉 SESSION COMPLETE: The Quibbler quality control system successfully caught destructive behavior, guided recovery, and ensured proper task tracking. The monitoring system is fully functional and the agent has learned from the experience.
